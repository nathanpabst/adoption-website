# Adoption-Website

## Description
This application is used for people who are searching for a new pet. When you click the 'cat', 'dog', or 'dino' button, the other other pet types disappear and the user can see only the pet type they selected. If the user decides to switch to a different pet type, she can do that as well. Concepts covered: Bootstrap, ES6, JSON, traversing the DOM, event-listeners, Grunt, and ESlint.
